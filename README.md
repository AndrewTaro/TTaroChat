# TTaro Chat
This mod enables the customization of chat, including the player's ship name, icon, etc.
It also allows you to export the chat messages so that external applications can process, and import custom text to display it.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!

# Requirements
You must install the following in order to use the mod.
- [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)
